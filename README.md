### Hey, I'm Marc 👋

I'm a Senior Full Stack Developer building **HugeCP**, a powerful DDoS mitigation platform with a real-time dashboard for network traffic, anomaly reports, customer ASN visibility, and BGP monitoring.

💻 Backend? Django, DRF, Celery, Redis, ClickHouse — I’ve got it covered.  
🌐 Frontend? Vue 3 + Vite + Vuetify, with state management via Pinia and dynamic permissions using CASL.  
🐳 DevOps? Docker-first, with Nginx, health checks, structured logging, and background tasks handled like clockwork.  
📊 I log like a pro and visualize it all in Grafana — from API traffic analytics to system performance stats.  
🛠️ I'm not afraid of ZFS, OpenSSL compilation, pfSense firewall rules, or low-level Linux automation.

Whether it's managing live production environments, building real-time systems with WebSocket + RabbitMQ, or just giving my Xiaomi scooter a battery upgrade — I go deep. 🧠⚡

Let’s connect, debug, and deploy something awesome!
